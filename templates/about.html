        <p>The University of Nottingham's Women In Technology conference day is for everyone; tech enthusiasts, non-programmers, students at college or university and women or men from all walks of life.</p>
	<p>Only 14.4% of STEM jobs in the UK are occupied by women and out of all the CS students in the UK only 17.4% are female. </p>
	<p>This event strives to celebrate the individuals behind the figures, and share their fascinating life experiences in the tech industry. </p>

	<p>There will be three parts to the day; talks from some of the most fascinating women within the tech industry, workshops; from hands on programming to smaller talks, and opportunities to network with some of the best companies around.</p>
	<p> HackSoc and the University of Nottingham have teamed up to inspire and encourage students to pursue technology as a hobby or as a career.</p>
	<p>We want to get students excited by their potential.</p>
