				<p>The University of Nottingham's Women In Technology conference day is for everyone; tech enthusiasts, non-programmers, students at college or university and women or men from all walks of life.</p>

				<p>Only 14.4% of STEM jobs in the UK are occupied by women and out of all the CS students in the UK only 17.4% are female. This event strives to celebrate the individuals behind the figures, and share their fascinating life experiences in the tech industry.</p>

				<p>HackSoc and the University of Nottingham have teamed up to inspire and encourage students to pursue technology as a hobby or as a career.</p>
